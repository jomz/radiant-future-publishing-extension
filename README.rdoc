= Future publishing

The future publishing extension makes it possible to publish a page at a certain time in the future.

= This extension has been merged into Radiant 0.9 and is thus obsolete
= keeping this around for people with pre-0.9 Radiant instances

Created by Benny Degezelle for www.belmodo.tv

== Usage

Use the default published_at datetime_select controls to pick the date that you want to publish a page. If you haven't done so allready, you will have to set a config option through the settings extension or console. Namely:

  Radiant::Config['page.edit.published_date?'] = true

== Warning:

In order for this extension to work properly, you will have to set the correct timezone in your environment.rb. Not doing so will probably result in bad Time comparing..
To do this, put this inside your Radiant::Initializer block: 

  config.time_zone = "Brussels"
  
You can run this rake task to find out your timezone:

  rake time:zones:local
